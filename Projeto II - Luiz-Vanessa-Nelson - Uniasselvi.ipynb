        "As empresas centradas nos clientes consideram prioritária a mensuração da qualidade dos serviços e a satisfação dos seus usuários. Comparar o desempenho da empresa com a expectativa é a base do conceito de satisfação dos clientes. Esse indicador está relacionado ao maior retorno sobre o investimento (ROI), fidelização, volume de compras e valorização da marca. Um sistema de avaliação da satisfação é a base para decisões quanto à gestão da qualidade dos serviços. Entretanto, a obtenção desses dados é feita por levantamentos envolvendo diversos fatores do ciclo de serviço, que geralmente tem muitas etapas, sendo que algumas delas não são percebidas ou valorizadas pelos clientes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Os fatores que mais contribuem para a satisfação devem ser valorizados e comunicados para sua clientela, o que pode gerar um círculo virtuoso de mais satisfação, mais vendas e mais lucros. A moldagem dos fatores que geram satisfação ou que evitam a insatisfação faz com que as empresas modifiquem as operações e ações de marketing.\n",

We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 213,\n            'f': \"213\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"29-Jul-18\",\n\"Charcoal Fabric \",\n\"Home entertainment\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 214,\n            'f': \"214\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 4,\n            'f': \"4\",\n        },\n\"29-Jul-18\",\n\"Heather Gray Fabric \",\n\"Very cool product.

Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 255,\n            'f': \"255\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"29-Jul-18\",\n\"Heather Gray Fabric \",\n\"We are loving Ours very much\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 256,\n            'f': \"256\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"29-Jul-18\",\n\"Heather Gray Fabric \",\n\"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best.

I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I\\u2019ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I\\u2019m not sure if this is the norm or if it\\u2019s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don\\u2019t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic\\u2019s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple\\u2019s Siri is that when she\\u2019s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the \\u201cHey Siri\\u201d feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven\\u2019t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I\\u2019m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations \\u2014 support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can\\u2019t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would\\u2019ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don\\u2019t want to though \\u2014 Alexa\\u2019s kind of growing on me.\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 564,\n            'f': \"564\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"11-Jun-18\",\n\"Black\",\n\"I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs.

Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer.

It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music.

I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries.

Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.

My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.

Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. The Echo Spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that.

In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.

Honestly I didn't really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, I love it.  Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn't get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I'd love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can't the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it's a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can't tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration.\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 1323,\n            'f': \"1323\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"21-Jul-18\",\n\"Black  Spot\",\n\"The screen response time is way better than I expected.

I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn\\u2019t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying \\u201cAlexa set an alarm for 5am\\u201d and then having Alexa repeat \\u201cOK alarm set for 5am.\\u201d  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990\\u2019s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I\\u2019m picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I\\u2019m in the shower.\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 1384,\n            'f': \"1384\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"17-Jul-18\",\n\"Black  Spot\",\n\"I bought this for my mother and she loves it!

Super easy to set up & get started, a breeze to do routine tasks (set alarms, timers, add items to shopping/to do lists, play music, get news, just about anything it's supposed to do). The sound is good where Imhave it sitting, not tinny at all as some have found. There is one thing I HATE & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone - you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask Alexa. Unless you have her turn off the screen totally which I do when I go to bed. And it's too bad bc it's like a continuously running advertisement or set-up guide. Not attractive. The echo show was on sale prior to Prime day for less than the Echo, so I figured I was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with. Because of the ever present script it's not a nice device to look at, I would not buy it again, or recommend - go with the Echo.

I\\u2019m going off to live on campus for school in the fall and we got two of these to serve as an easy way to connect. Some people might not like the camera but that makes little sense.

It\\u2019s definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versa.I\\u2019d also like to thank Amazon for including their VoiceView screen reader on the device. The Show would be a lot less blind friendly, even with Alexa present, if they hadn\\u2019t included that.We are an echo-loving household with two dots, three echos, and now two Shows.

This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker.

What I didn't know was the Z-wave lock and Zigbee Alexa hub weren't compatible.  Does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with Echo Plus?  If not, I guess my choices are: 1. Exchange the Plus for a regular Echo and buy a separate hub like Wink.  2. Return the whole Alexa system and get something else.I  don't want to just buy another hub to use along side my Echo Plus or I'll be back here asking how to integrate two hubs.The reason I kept from buying smart systems up to this point  is because I was afraid they wouldn't operate seamlessly and unfortunately I only do enough research after something doesn't work.\",\n{\n            'v': 0,\n            'f': \"0\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 1815,\n            'f': \"1815\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"29-Jul-18\",\n\"Black  Plus\",\n\"This Echo Plus has proved to be the most innovative improvement in my life!\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 1816,\n            'f': \"1816\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"29-Jul-18\",\n\"White  Plus\",\n\"I purchased the Amazon Echo Plus on Amazon prime day because I need a hub.

I got a hub that works with my devices, plus it does a lot more. I haven't even had time to go through all the skills it has, but I've already found myself using many of them. When I started a search for a hub. I wasn't even considering the Echo. In part, because I didn't know it was a hub. But also because I didn't really think I would find much use for another AI system. If you're looking for a hub. Why settle for a plane hub, when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost's the same or less than other hubs? Oh! And by the way. For the same price as the Amazon Echo Plus alone. I found one that came bundled with a smart bulb & saw another that came with a smart plug. Given the price of these extras.

Philips Hue Light Bulbs were placed in the fixtures that I wanted Alexa to control and they all work great!  I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs.  But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus.  I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices.  The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work..  The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work. Regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with Alexa and  the Echo Plus with Hub.  Other than the high price of the bulbs, I love my Echo Plus with built in hub!\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 1847,\n            'f': \"1847\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"28-Jul-18\",\n\"Black  Plus\",\n\"Easily configured hub capabilities.

Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home.

The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.

They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the  original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2005,\n            'f': \"2005\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 2,\n            'f': \"2\",\n        },\n\"20-Jul-18\",\n\"White  Plus\",\n\"Why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with Samsung TV's and many other devices?

The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2017,\n            'f': \"2017\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 4,\n            'f': \"4\",\n        },\n\"20-Jul-18\",\n\"Black  Plus\",\n\"Easy to Install.

I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again.

She turns on and off lights, she's the core of my smart home.\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2053,\n            'f': \"2053\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"11-Jul-18\",\n\"Black  Plus\",\n\"I love it best gift I got myself\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2054,\n            'f': \"2054\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"10-Jul-18\",\n\"Black  Plus\",\n\"I love the sound very good.

Needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I'd wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn't been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I'll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. Haven't tried it yet, although I don't think it'll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I'm using right now. So far I'm loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed.\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2235,\n            'f': \"2235\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"30-Jul-18\",\n\"Configuration: Fire TV Stick\",\n\"Everything\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2236,\n            'f': \"2236\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"30-Jul-18\",\n\"Configuration: Fire TV Stick\",\n\"Love this!\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2237,\n            'f': \"2237\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"30-Jul-18\",\n\"Configuration: Fire TV Stick\",\n\"Really enjoying my firestick can\\u2019t wait to get rid of  cable such a waste of money.\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2238,\n            'f': \"2238\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"30-Jul-18\",\n\"Configuration: Fire TV Stick\",\n\"Good\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2239,\n            'f': \"2239\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"30-Jul-18\",\n\"Configuration: Fire TV Stick\",\n\"Love it!\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2240,\n            'f': \"2240\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"30-Jul-18\",\n\"Configuration: Fire TV Stick\",\n\"Easy to set up and use.\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2241,\n            'f': \"2241\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"30-Jul-18\",\n\"Configuration: Fire TV Stick\",\n\"WooHoo! $20 on Prime Day; done!\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2242,\n            'f': \"2242\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"30-Jul-18\",\n\"Configuration: Fire TV Stick\",\n\"Perfect\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2243,\n            'f': \"2243\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"30-Jul-18\",\n\"Configuration: Fire TV Stick\",\n\"Very easy to use!

Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that\\u2019s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2503,\n            'f': \"2503\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"30-Jul-18\",\n\"White  Dot\",\n\"Great product\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2504,\n            'f': \"2504\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"30-Jul-18\",\n\"Black  Dot\",\n\"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        }],\n [{\n            'v': 2505,\n            'f': \"2505\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n\"30-Jul-18\",\n\"Black  Dot\",\n\"Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.

              "\"Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.\""
